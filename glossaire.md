### Base Impacts

:flag_cp: Ouverte au public en 2014, la [Base Impacts](https://www.base-impacts.ademe.fr) est la base de données génériques développée et gérée par l’[ADEME](https://www.ademe.fr) pour le programme français d'**affichage environnemental des produits de grande consommation**. Ces données servent au calcul des notes environnementales affichées sur les produits/services. ([source](https://www.base-impacts.ademe.fr/documents/MiseenoeuvreAffichageenvironnemental_Vf_mai2020.pdf))

### Co-Product

__:flag_um: A co-product is defined as “‘**any of two or more products coming from the same unit process or product system”**. ([source](https://www.base-impacts.ademe.fr/documents/1.1\_Affichageenvironnemental_AE_Documentstransversaux.zip))

### ILCD

__:flag_um: _International Life Cycle Data (System)_. A **data format** allowing users to exchange data that was previously thought incompatible, bringing many more datasets, models and methods within reach of [LCA](glossaire.md#lca) practitioners ([source](https://pre-sustainability.com/articles/the-ilcd-format-solving-lca-data-exchange-problems/))

### LCA

__:flag_um: _Life Cycle Assessment (or Analysis)_ is a **methodology** for **assessing environmental impacts** associated with all the stages of the life cycle of a commercial product, process, or service ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_assessment))

### LCI

__:flag_um: _Life cycle inventory (LCI)_ is the **methodology step** that involves creating an inventory of **input and output flows for a product system**. Such flows include inputs of water, energy, and raw materials, and releases to air, land, and water. The inventory can be based on literature analysis or on process simulation ([source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/life-cycle-inventory))

### LCIA

__:flag_um: [Life Cycle Inventory](glossaire.md#lci) analysis is followed by a _Life Cycle Impact Assessment_ (LCIA). This phase of LCA is aimed at **evaluating the potential environmental and human health impacts** resulting from the elementary flows determined in the [LCI](glossaire.md#lci). ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_assessment#Life_Cycle_Impact_Assessment_\(LCIA\)))

### PEF

__:flag_um: _Product Environmental Footprint_ is a **Life Cycle Assessment based method** **to quantify the environmental impacts of products** (goods or services). It builds on existing approaches and international standards. The overarching purpose of PEF information is to enable to reduce the environmental impacts of goods and services taking into account supply chain activities (from extraction of raw materials, through production and use and to final waste management). 

This purpose is achieved through the **provision of detailed requirements for modelling the environmental impacts** of the flows of material/energy and the emissions and waste streams associated with a product throughout its life cycle. ([source](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/smgp/pdf/product-environmental-footprint-PEF-methode_en.pdf))

### PEFCR

__:flag_um: _Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules_. **Rulesets associated to a **[**PEF**](glossaire.md#pef). ([example for t-shirts](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/smgp/pdf/PEFCR_tshirt.pdf))

### Recycled Content

__:flag_um:**Proportion, by mass, of recycled material in a product or packaging**. Only pre-consumer and post-consumer materials shall be considered as recycled content, consistent with the following usage of terms ([source](https://www.base-impacts.ademe.fr/documents/1.1\_Affichageenvironnemental_AE_Documentstransversaux.zip))
